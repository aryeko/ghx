## Standard CTA
1. `npx @ghx-dev/core capabilities list`
2. `npx @ghx-dev/core run repo.view --input '{"owner":"aryeko","name":"ghx"}'`

## Post Template
Use this structure in each post:
1. Hook
2. Proof framing
3. CTA pair
4. FAQ objection block

## Post 1
Hook: Most agent GitHub automation still pays an avoidable discovery tax every run.
Proof framing: `ghx` provides typed capabilities and normalized outputs. Final benchmark values pending snapshot sign-off (`<MODEL_ID>`, `<N_RUNS>`).
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "Why not keep direct scripts only?" Because repeated reliability controls become duplicated maintenance work.

## Post 2
Hook: Reliable automation starts with consistent contracts, not longer prompts.
Proof framing: capability contracts and deterministic route behavior reduce execution variance.
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "Is this just abstraction overhead?" It removes repeated routing and output-normalization overhead.

## Post 3
Hook: If your agent can open issues but cannot close loops reliably, adoption stalls.
Proof framing: `ghx` focuses on complete GitHub workflow coverage with predictable envelopes.
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "Can this work with existing agent frameworks?" Yes, via CLI and library surfaces.

## Post 4
Hook: Benchmarks are useful only when fixtures and scenario intent are explicit.
Proof framing: stabilization process is complete before any final metrics are published.
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "Why no numbers yet?" Claim integrity requires finalized snapshot evidence.

## Post 5
Hook: Fast onboarding is a growth feature for dev tooling.
Proof framing: two commands get first capability discovery and first task execution.
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "Will setup be complex?" Start with `npx`, then adopt deeper flows.

## Post 6
Hook: Agentic GitHub reliability is less about model cleverness and more about interfaces.
Proof framing: typed capability contracts reduce brittle ad hoc behaviors.
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "Is this tied to one provider?" No, this focuses on execution contract consistency.

## Post 7
Hook: You can improve automation without rewriting your entire stack.
Proof framing: adopt capability-by-capability for high-friction workflows first.
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "Do we need full migration day one?" No, incremental adoption works.

## Post 8
Hook: Bench claims should be copied from one snapshot, not assembled from memory.
Proof framing: all channels will share the same imported placeholders once finalized.
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "Why strict process?" It prevents inconsistent public claims.

## Post 9
Hook: Integrations into agent ecosystems matter more than isolated announcements.
Proof framing: first wave includes LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, PydanticAI, and smolagents plans.
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "What if maintainers decline PRs?" fallback is standalone docs and examples.

## Post 10
Hook: Installed users who complete a first run are the metric that matters first.
Proof framing: launch tracking prioritizes confirmed first successful runs over impressions.
CTA: use standard CTA.
FAQ objection: "What about stars?" useful signal, but not the primary adoption KPI.
