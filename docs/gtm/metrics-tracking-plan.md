# Metrics Tracking Plan

## Primary KPI
First successful run completions after install onboarding.

## Secondary Proxy KPI
Issue comments, discussion replies, or social replies that include successful command output from:
1. `npx @ghx-dev/core capabilities list`
2. `npx @ghx-dev/core run repo.view --input '{"owner":"aryeko","name":"ghx"}'`

## Weekly Dashboard Fields
1. Install estimate.
2. First-run confirmations.
3. Docs click-through.
4. Integration PR merge count.
5. Community mentions.

## Data Collection Cadence
1. Daily quick capture during launch week.
2. Weekly rollup after launch week.

## Interpretation Rules
1. Prioritize confirmed first runs over impression volume.
2. Treat social engagement as supporting signal, not core success metric.
3. Use integration PR outcomes as distribution leverage indicator.
