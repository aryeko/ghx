## Standard CTA
1. `npx @ghx-dev/core capabilities list`
2. `npx @ghx-dev/core run repo.view --input '{"owner":"aryeko","name":"ghx"}'`

## Post Template
Each short post contains:
1. Hook
2. Proof framing
3. CTA pair
4. FAQ objection block

## Twenty Short Posts
1. Hook: Agent workflows lose time re-learning GitHub surfaces. Proof framing: `ghx` gives typed capabilities and stable envelopes. FAQ objection: "Is this overkill?" Not for repeated workflows.
2. Hook: Better contracts beat larger prompts for execution reliability. Proof framing: deterministic routing and normalized results. FAQ objection: "Can I still use gh?" yes, this standardizes outcomes.
3. Hook: First-run success matters more than vanity metrics. Proof framing: launch KPI is installed users completing one successful run. FAQ objection: "Why not stars first?" stars do not confirm execution value.
4. Hook: Benchmark process matters as much as benchmark results. Proof framing: snapshot-first claim policy. FAQ objection: "Where are the final numbers?" inserted after sign-off.
5. Hook: Remove route-selection guesswork from agents. Proof framing: capability ids encode intent and route policy. FAQ objection: "Will this hide details?" no, outputs remain explicit.
6. Hook: Standard envelopes reduce parser glue code. Proof framing: one result shape across capabilities. FAQ objection: "Can I still inspect raw behavior?" yes via tooling and metadata.
7. Hook: Two commands to first value. Proof framing: list capabilities then run `repo.view`. FAQ objection: "Need global install?" no, use `npx`.
8. Hook: Reliability should be designed, not improvised. Proof framing: schema validation + error normalization. FAQ objection: "Will this slow us down?" it removes repeated retries/guesswork.
9. Hook: Your agent can stop treating GitHub like a new API each run. Proof framing: stable contracts. FAQ objection: "Does this fit existing systems?" yes, incremental adoption.
10. Hook: Good launch discipline prevents trust debt. Proof framing: no numeric claims before snapshot import. FAQ objection: "Is that too strict?" it preserves credibility.
11. Hook: CI diagnostics should be predictable, not bespoke. Proof framing: capability-first execution patterns. FAQ objection: "Will this cover all edge cases?" coverage expands batch by batch.
12. Hook: Project and issue ops need the same reliability bar as PR ops. Proof framing: shared interface model across domains. FAQ objection: "Do we need full migration now?" no.
13. Hook: Reproducibility is part of product quality. Proof framing: benchmark isolation and fixture lifecycle. FAQ objection: "Can I replicate this?" yes with fixture manifests.
14. Hook: Avoid ad hoc command chains for core automation loops. Proof framing: intent-first capabilities. FAQ objection: "Is direct CLI simpler?" only at tiny scale.
15. Hook: Growth for dev tools starts at first successful run. Proof framing: CTA anchored to immediate command success. FAQ objection: "What about social reach?" secondary.
16. Hook: Performance claims should name model and sample size. Proof framing: claim contract requires context. FAQ objection: "Why include this detail?" for comparison integrity.
17. Hook: Integration paths into existing ecosystems drive adoption. Proof framing: prepared PR packets per target repo. FAQ objection: "What if review is slow?" fallback path is ready.
18. Hook: Stable error semantics save debugging time. Proof framing: normalized error envelopes. FAQ objection: "Will this mask root causes?" no, metadata remains available.
19. Hook: Agent workflows fail when contracts are implicit. Proof framing: explicit schemas and capability docs. FAQ objection: "Is schema work heavy?" done once, reused many times.
20. Hook: Launch only after evidence is final. Proof framing: single-snapshot metric import step. FAQ objection: "Can we preview now?" yes, with placeholders only.
