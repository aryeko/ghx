Add composite capability execution support to the refactored GraphQL architecture, including batched alias-based composite routing and GraphQL-first `pr.review.submit` handling with inline comments.

Also adds issue composite operation cards and aligns routing/output contracts and tests with aliased imports and the new gql domain/client layout.
